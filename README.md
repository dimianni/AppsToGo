# AppsToGo 

[AppsToGo](https://dimianni.github.io/AppsToGo/) is a landing page template I have built while being a partner at [Duol Studio](https://duolstudio.com/). The website is developed upon my [Gulp configuration](https://github.com/dimianni/gulp_config).

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/AppsToGo.git
```

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) globally on computer.

Then, install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) globally with this command:

```bash
   npm i --global gulp-cli
```

After having installed Node and Gulp, and cloning the repo, run the following command in the folder's terminal:

```bash
  npm i 
```

node_modules folder and all the dependencies will be downloaded.

## Usage

There are only two commands.

This will start a development server:
```bash
gulp
```

This will create a production build:
```bash
gulp build
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Source code is located in the app folder.
