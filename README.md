# AppsToGo 

[AppsToGo](https://dimianni.github.io/AppsToGo/) is a landing page template I have built while being a partner at [Duol Studio](https://duolstudio.com/). The website is developed upon my [Gulp configuration](https://github.com/dimianni/gulp_config).

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/AppsToGo.git
```

## Usage

There are just a few commands to be aware of:

This will start a development server:
```bash
npm run start
```

This will create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Source code is located in the app folder.
